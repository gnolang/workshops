# Gno Live Coding Sessions

Hello! Welcome to the Gno Live Coding Sessions directory.

Gno Live Coding sessions (GnoLCS) are a educational initiative meant to provide
new builders with practical examples of how to build applications with Gno & gno.land.

Each subfolder of this directory is meant to contain a few things:
- A README file with a brief overview of that specific GnoLCS topic 
- Code created during the session
- A `followup-work` folder, which anyone can use to add their added work or code 
improvements to the code built during the session.
- Other useful information

Currently, the sessions are hosted on the [official gno.land Discord server](https://discord.gg/S8nKUqwkPn).
Check out the active events on the server for the upcoming Gno Live Coding session.
