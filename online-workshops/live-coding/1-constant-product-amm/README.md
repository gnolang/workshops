# Gno Live Coding Session #1

#### Topic: Minimal Constant Product GRC20 AMM in Gno
#### Date: Friday, Aug 16th 2024
#### Presenter: [@leohhhn](https://github.com/leohhhn)

This live coding session was the first Gno Live coding session.
It included building a basic [`GRC20`](https://gno.land/p/demo/grc/grc20) DEX
in Gno with the [constant product AMM](https://medium.com/@solidity101/the-constant-product-automated-market-maker-amm-294976dbb657)
algorithm. The base implementation only handles two GRC20 tokens:
[`wugnot`](https://gno.land/r/demo/wugnot) & [`foo20`](https://gno.land/r/demo/foo20).

## Following up

We encourage anyone who wishes to build upon the example given in the coding
session to do so. Please make a PR adding your code to the 
[`followup-work/`](./followup-work) folder, and ping the presenter.
