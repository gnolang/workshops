# Web3 Kamp 2024 - gno.land workshop

Welcome to the Web3 Kamp 2024 gno.land workshop!

This workshop is meant for developers that have little to no knowledge of Go/Gno,
but have at least a beginner amount of knowledge in other blockchain systems
(such as Ethereum).

In this workshop, you will learn the basics of programming in gno.land, and build a 
simple Twitter clone using the Gno language. 

This workshop contains phases; each phase is meant to be a stepping stone in the 
development process to the next one. Check out the [phases](./phases) folder to start.
