     |      +++                 In this presentation, when I mention 'GitHub' or
      \      =+                 'Open-Source', keep in mind that the same ideas
       \      +                 apply to platforms like 'GitLab' and encompass
       |\++++++                 concepts like 'free software'.
       |  ++++      ||//        Please take these terms broadly.
