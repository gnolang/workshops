## Bonjour, dAppcon!

## Intro to Gno

## Intro to Gno: a new era in smart sontracting, and open-source

- Gno: Comprehensive smart contract suite: Gno.land (chain) + Gnolang (language).
- Created by Cosmos co-founder Jae Kwon.
- Gno.land: The first L1 using Gnolang, a Go-based language for smart contracts.
- Built on Tendermint2, Cosmos/IBC, secured by Proof of Contribution.
- Prioritizes simplicity, security, and scalability.
- Gnoweb: Integrated dApp server for contract interactions, no extra servers needed.

.code ./code/gnoland-schema.txt

## Gnolang, a multi-user programming language

- Gnolang: Go-based language for smart contracting.
- Powers Gno.land and future GnoVM-based blockchains.
- Multi-user design enhances developer and app interaction.
- Creates shared virtual environment, akin to developer MMORPG.

.code ./code/deps.txt

## Multi-User programming, deep contract interactions

- Contracts: callable and importable, unifying apps and libraries.
- Breaks from GitHub/NPM (libraries) or Ethereum/AWS (apps) norms.
- Imported contracts offer type safety, rich types.
- Dependencies maintain state; changes during interaction are applied.
- Enables cheap, efficient interactions with concise code.

.code ./code/deep-contract-interactions.go

## Multi-user programming: transparency, readability, audibility

- GnoVM uses human-readable paths for contracts, unlike EVM's hashes.
- No bytecodes, just plain, readable source code.
- Promotes simplicity, removes ambiguity for users and developers.
- Enhances contract discovery, reading, and auditing.

## Gno.land: GitHub for smart contracts

## Gno.land: GitHub for smart contracts

- Gno.land encourages reusing, importing, forking, and composing contracts.
- Provides source code, execution, metadata, and metrics (including deps/libraries).
- Metrics act as trust indicators, akin to GitHub stars or forks or NPM downloads.
- Developers can inspect contract creators (user or organization), similar to GitHub.
- Enables dependency monitoring, boosting transparency and trust.
- More than a platform, Gno.land is a developer community.

.code ./code/hello-world.go

## Gno.land: simplifying smart contract development

- Remember the arrival of GitHub? Open-source existed, but it wasn't simple or social.
- It replaced the tedious process of finding and compiling tarballs with easy browsing and discovery.
- Gno.land aims to do the same for smart contracts.
- It's not just about executing contracts, but also about reusing, importing, forking, and composing them.
- Gno.land: Making smart contract development easier and more accessible.

## Gno.land: applying the GitHub effect to contract execution

- Merging GitHub's source code management with contract execution.
- Key feature? Transparent, reusable, accessible contract state (data).
- Contracts on Gno.land: Source code and state combined.
- Access contract state with its source, and printf debug like it's local.

.code ./code/repl-debug.txt

## Gno.land: proof-of-contribution, rewarding good code

- Gno.land replaces Proof of Stake with Proof of Contribution.
- Focus shifts from investment to contributions.
- Developers are encouraged to write good quality code.
- Aligns with open-source ethos of community contribution and recognition.
- Proof of Contribution benefits both the project and the developer.

## New Open-Source paradigm

## Beyond the langage, a new open-source paradigm

- Open-source is about creating new knowledge and fostering connections.
- Traditional smart contracts have been focused on isolation, existing in bubbles.
- Gno.land aims to bring the spirit of open-source to smart contracts.
- We envision a constantly growing creative world with new contracts, libraries, interconnections, and possibilities.

## Amplifying Open-Source

- Gno.land enriches, rather than challenges, open-source.
- We treasure open-source and magnify its foundation.
- Our platform integrates execution, auditability, verification, and trust.
- Given the surge of Gno contracts, conventional open-source might appear constrained.
- It's akin to the GitHub effect on its own ecosystem.

.code ./code/oss-ethos.txt

## The GitHub Revolution

**Before GitHub:**
- Open-source existed, but it was isolated and challenging.
- Collaboration was tedious; discovery was a maze.
- Trust and transparency were often compromised.

**After GitHub:**
- Open-source became social, accessible, and dynamic.
- Trust in code through community endorsements (stars, forks).
- Can we even imagine reverting? It would be a massive step back.

## Gno.land's Ambition

- Elevate smart contracts as GitHub transformed open-source.
- Make bytecode contracts and clouds feel dated.
- Champion transparency, collaboration and trust in modern development.
- Reward meaningful code with Proof of Contribution.
