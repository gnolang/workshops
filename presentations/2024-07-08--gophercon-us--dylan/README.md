# gc24-us-workshop

Welcome to the gno.land workshop!

This workshop is divided into five phases, located in the [phases](./phases) folder.

Start in [phase 1](./phases/p1) to set up your local development environment.

The README.md files for each phase contain instructions on how to complete it.

At the end of each phase, the solution will be pushed to the subsequent phase's folder. This way,
you can continue to follow along with the phases without having to have completely finished the previous.

Members of the gno.land team will be around to help out if you run into issues.
