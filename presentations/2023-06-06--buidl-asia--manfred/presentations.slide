Summary: Gno.land is placing contributors at the center of security consensus by focusing on fair rewards to positive contributors. This talk will explain the consensus mechanism of proof of contribution, a fair recognition of contributors base on the level of contribution, through the current Game of Realms contest.

## What is Gno?
- Gnolang/GnoVM: comprehensive smart contract suite, based on Golang
- Gno.land: first L1 using Gnolang
- built on Tendermint2 in the Cosmos/IBC ecosystem
- aims for fairness, simplicity, security, scalability
- -> long-term viability

## What is proof of contribution (PoC)?
- consensus mechanism (PoW, PoS, PoA, etc.)
- removes financial incentives
- focus on expertise and values
- **disclaimer: still WIP!**

## What makes a (good) contribution?
- quality, collaboration â‰¥ final merge status -> rewarding useful failures
- template or free-form; onchain, on GitHub, or other platforms; tech-related, or not
- predefined tasks or unsollicited, complete or part of a solution

.code ./code/examples-of-contributions.txt
- -> judged by the **Evaluation DAO**

## What is the Evaluation DAO?
- a smart contract framework
- for reviewing, measuring, and accepting contributions
- not the consensus mechanism but rather a platform
- scales itself -> managed by its members; serving as entrypoint to become a new member
- V1 is currently being developed as a GoR (Game of Realms) task
- score: **^worx**

## ^worx: gamified contributions
- symbol for quantifying contributions
- broadens contribution definition beyond traditional work
- signifies appreciation for all forms of contribution, fostering engagement, creativity and collaboration
- plural form for diversity and unquantifiable nature of contributions
- not tradable (not `$WORX`), but holds value within the community
- potential for annotations with tags with tags for automatic quantified expertises
- empowers contributors, promotes a sense of ownership
- one of the main metrics used in the **Contributors DAO**

## What is the Contributors DAO?
- ecosystem for recognizing, coordinating, and incentivizing contributors
- the community owning the chain, responsible for its evolution
- tiered memberships with different rules and powers
- manages funding, elects validators, and participate in governance
- scalable from various community sizes, with **subDAOs** for specialized coordination

## What are SubDAOs?
- "IDAO", IBC for DAOs, "internet of DAOs""
- -> a tree structure, composed of DAOs with relationships
- robust relationship protocol
- -> top-down -> vision, OKRs, budget
- -> bottom-up -> backlog, contributions, reports
- DAOs are `interface{}` implementations
- automatic dashboards, reports

.code ./code/subdaos.txt

## What is proof of contribution?

- a consensus mechanism, securing and decentralizing a chain
- and a whole DAO ecosystem to govern the chain and the ecosystem
- -> Evaluation DAO, Contributors DAO, SubDAOs, etc.

## Not limited to a single chain -> IBC

## Proof of contribution -- expertise, values?

- thanks to multiple membership level we can expect to have:
- levels with few constraints where it's easy to get started and harder to raise

.code ./code/tiered-memberships.txt

## Evaluation DAO

- has a mission to scale itself
- aims to decentralize the review
- aims to scale the reviews
- aims to attribute contributing score and expertises on public keys
- part of GoR

## Proof of contribution -- Satoshi Score?

- on platforms like PoW and PoS, someone with a huge amount of money could more easily take a very high voting power
- on PoC, we can expect that takeovers would be made nearly impossible because it's harder and slower to become high-tiered member, we can expect to have a very good uniqueness efficiency (1 tiered member is 1 human)
- with a reasonable amount of high-level members, we can expect to have at least 2 kind of votes considered very decentralized: 1-vote-per-member; and dynamic voting power based on the tiered level
- we can have like in PoS someone arriving in one day and taking most of the voting power because they are rich

## Can I use PoC on my blockchain?

- you can, but it's difficult and slow to set up, while PoS and PoW are a way easier and faster to run
- alternatively, you will be able to use ICS and increase your security thanks to gno.land

## Governance
 * focus on expertise and values
 * -> remove financial incentives!
 * tiers of members
 * top tier has sufficient (1) contributions, (2) expertise, and (3) values
 * $GNOT: a fee token with self governance

- Graphic: Simple conceptual diagram of PoC.
- Proof-of-Contribution, a concept that is planned to replace Proof-of-Stake in the Gno.land blockchain.
- Game of realms: ongoing competition, preliminary phase to proof-of-contributions

## What is Game of realms?

- similar to game of stakes
- experiment to test PoC
- to developer the first bricks
- to bootstrap the contributors' community

## Deep dives

## Why do we need a consensus mechanism, and why its quality and features matter?

- to achieve network security and decentralization (validators)
- to prevent takeovers
- to prevent alliances

## Gno.land Contributors DAO

-

## Why proof of contributions?

- Tokens can be a corrupting factor for projects
- Some people prioritize making money over project principles and values
- Creating a governance model independent of financial fungible tokens
- No Land aims to be independent of tokenomics for governance
- Fee token will exist but won't govern No Land
- License model allows creation of custom Power Chains with any token
- The goal is to have at least one blockchain independent of tokenomics for governance
- No Land aims to serve as a GitHub-like platform for other chains.

## How proof of contributions works?

- validator set: similar to PoA, but authority == DAO of contributors

- how to manage exceptions: book

## What is a contribution

## How to manage conflict

## Isn't it too slow/heavy/constraintful?

## Is it safe enough for advanced cases?

## Contributors at the center of the security consensus

## Voting powerS

## A new model for validators

## A network of chains, ICS

## The case of the book writer

## Specialization

## Progressive DAOization

## What to expect for the future?

## In 1y

- mainnet
- gnovm v1.0
- 10s core contributors
- 100s of simple contributors

## In 10y

- mainnets
- gnovm vX?
- gnovm alternatives/forks?
- 100s core contributors
- 10000s of simple contributors

## In 100y

## Game of Realms: Overview
- Overview of Game of Realms, explaining that it's divided into two phases and that the project is currently in phase 1.
- Graphic: Timeline of Game of Realms' phases.

## Phase 1: Tasks and Evaluation
- Describe the primary tasks of phase 1: Evaluation DAO, Tutorials, and Governance Module.
- Discuss how contributions are evaluated in this phase and the role of the Evaluation DAO.
- Graphic: Flowchart showing the process of contribution submission, review, and reward allocation.

## Phase 2: Evaluation DAO in action
- Discuss the role of the Evaluation DAO in phase 2, where it reviews old and ongoing contributions.
- Graphic: Diagram showing the Evaluation DAO in action, reviewing and allocating points to contributions.

## The Contribution Process
- Detail the process of contributing to the project, including registration, submitting tasks, and participating in community discussions.
- Graphic: Step-by-step guide or flowchart of the contribution process.

## Fairness and Transparency in Proof of Contribution
- Discuss how the Proof of Contribution model ensures fairness and transparency in rewarding contributors. Explain the concept of "point dilution" and how contributors won't lose points.
- Graphic: A graphical representation of how points are allocated and diluted.

## Benefits of Proof of Contribution
- Discuss the benefits of PoC, such as onboarding more contributors, improving the project, bootstrapping genesis of contributors for the future mainnet, and identifying the best participants for jobs and partnerships.
- Graphic: A list of benefits or a diagram illustrating the benefits of PoC.

## Future of Gno.land
